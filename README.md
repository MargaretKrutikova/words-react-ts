# Words App

A react app that should help me learn Swedish (and some frontend development, as a side effect of writing the app).
It is written in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), it gets data from a [graphql](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) API and uses some cool things like [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/), [styletron](https://github.com/styletron/styletron), [apollo-link](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link) and many more yet to come.
